’ Α. §L Cicero’s acquaintance with the Scaevolae. §a
Scaevola, the augur, happened to speak one day of a notorious
quarrel between two quondam friends, P. Sulpicius Rufus and'
Q. Pompeius. [Sulpicius was originally on the aristocratic side,
but being plebeian tribune in 88 B.c., he became a tool of Marius
and proposed some revolutionary laws. His former friend
Pompeius was consul, and vigorously opposed him. In a sight,
theson of Pompeius was slain3 aster which Sulla entered the
city withan army and Sulpicius was killed] ξ 3. This led
Scaevola to reporta conversation concerning friendship which
Laelius had held with his two sons-in-law, Scaevola himself and

whom men call wisc by a better title than that of Cato, bear the
death of your friend. It was remarlced that you missed the
meeting of the augurs lately!

ἕξ 8-ιο, Scaevola. ‘1 have told inquirers that your health‚
and not your sorrow, prevented you from attending.’

Laelius. ‘Right ; no private reason must ever withdraw a
consistent man from his duty. You are wrong, Fannius, about
Cato. If ever any man deserved the title wite, he did.¹

ἕξ 10—12. ‘I am indeed touched by Scipio's death, but the
sting is removed by the thought that I only, not Scipio, am the
sufferet. His life was splendid, his death was happily spcedy;
