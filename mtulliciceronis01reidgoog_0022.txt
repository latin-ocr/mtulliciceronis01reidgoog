is called in De officiii 1, 151 and in Ad Atticum 14, 21,3 Cato
metior. So the mss give to the Brntns (thus called by Cicero
in De divinatione 2, 3) the second title De clarit oratoribus.
Such double titles were not uncommon They are frequently
found in ancient citations of Plato’s works and in MSS3 eg.
Φιληβος, περὶ τάγαθοῦ. Varro alsowrote a great number of
books (called libii logistorici) which took their first titles from
the names of personS, their second titles from their subject·
matrerl. We may fairly conclude then that the proper com·
plete title of our dialogue is Laelius de amicitia.

c. T nne os wn'iing This has been implicitly given above
in the general account of Cicero's philosophical works. lt is
clear from De divinatione 2, 3 that when that work appeared,
the Laelius had not yet been written, while the Coto maior had
· already been published. In the De officiis (which had not been
mentioned in the passage of De divinatione above referred to)
there is a reference to the Laelius. The Caio maior was writ-
ten in the spring of 44 Μ. soon after Caesar’s death, and the
De officiis was completed in November of the same year2. As
Cicero was travelling during July and August, while September
and October were occupied by the De officiis, and probably
April and May by the De divinatione, we shall not greatly err
if we suppose the Laelius to have been composed in June of the
year 44 nc. It was a gloomy time for Cicero for many reasons,
but particularly because the high hopes concerning politics
which he entertained on Caesars death were already shattered.-
The circumstances of the time are to a great extent reflected in
the tone of the dialogue.

d. Thesbrm eff tlte dialogice. In general, ‘Cicero followed in
his philosophical works the plan of Aristotle’s dialogueS, now
lost, rather than that of the dialogues of Plato. In the former
there was more of exposition and less of discussion than in the
latter3 one person stated his views on some question, and the
company in attendance only made occasional remarks, without
attempting to debate the question. ln nearly all Plato's dia-
