ra hemicyclio: a large semicircular bench, not a part ol the household
sumiture, but placed outside in the grounds, and used lor conversations,
or lessons, the shape enabling the company to see each other’s laces. r>
So, at the outset ol the discussion in the Academica (1, 14), Cic. says
onmes in conspectu consedimus.

134 admodum: Lahmeyer is wrong in taking this with famaliares; it
qualihes pauci, as in Tusn 4, 6 nulla fere sunt out pauca admodum
Latino monumenta, though Cic. nearly always says admodum pauci
rather than pauci admodum ; cf. Tusc. a, 113 Top. 33 N. D. pff Leg.
3, 323 Phil. 3, 36 and 14, η. In 16, 1. ²5 we have gratum modum.

In sense, admodum exactly corresponds with our phrase ‘to a degree ’.

‘almost the last part'; also 5, l. ar nemo fere, ‘hardly any one’ ; 72, . ³²
Ἴ mansere. Lahmeyer, Nauck, and others err by supposingfere to qualisy
the words eratin ore, and to mean ‘generally ’‚ ,‘ commonly', like volgo,
lor which sens'e oi. 54,'·.l 125. ’ Fere nearly though not quite always
modifies the word which immediately precedes, and is olten joined with
expressions relating to time, when the time is not. fixed with absolute
' exactness. So Cic. Rep. a, 56 decem fere annm Pis. 13 quinto fere leora;
Caes. Β. G. 4, 23, rtmaafere ve‘gr'le'a. The Greek expressions ὡς ἔπος
εἰπεῖν, als εἰπεῖν (which have a verba] resemblance to the Latin phrase
ulpia dream, but do not resemble it in their sense) correspond very closely ’
to ere.

multis erol in ore: Cic. uses both constmctions, esse e'n ore alicui and
esse e‘n ore alieuius. Cf. Appendix on tum fere neuile's.
