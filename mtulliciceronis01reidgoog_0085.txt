7⁶ nn AMICITIA. [ς 12—

(of Pompeius) in quo uno ita summa fortuna cum marma vinula certavit
sowa tomani quam deae tribueretur ; Fam. 10, 3,a virtute duce, comite

P· 81.

1 accedere: sc. vel ad fortunam vel adgloriam·

ntorandi sensum: moriendi is the act or process oi dying3 mortis
would have a different meaning and could not be here substituted. Cs.
Cat. m. 74 sensus moriendi aliquis esse potest, post mortem quidem
sensus aut optandus aut nullus est‚· Phil. 9, 13 si quis cst suasus in
ntortc. On Scipio's death see Introd. p. 18.

a quo degenere mortis: ie. death so sudden as bis3 ior the form of
expression ci. n. on 4, l. 15.

3 vere: there is a loose contrast with difficile dictu cst, which implies
nihil veri potest dici.

4 celeberrimos: not ‘most famous' but (literally) ‘most attended by
crowds '‚ ie. days on which Scipio was the centre oi the popular interest.
Cf. my n. on Arch. 54.

5 clarissimum: ior the application of clarus to things, as well as
persons. Nagelsbach quotes Div. 2, 853 Att. 6, 1, aa clarissimi iuris
iurandi. N otice the emphasis given by the repetition of diem from diebus.

reductus cst: it was the custom at times of excitement ior leading
statesmen to be escorted to the senate-house from their homes and back
again by their admirers. For the escort away srom home deducere is
generally used, ior the escort homewards reducere. See Cat. m. 63,
where the two words occur together, as they do in Val. Max. a, 1 9.

6 ud vesperum: with the prepositions ad, sub, in, the accusative of
vesper is generally used and not that oi nemora.

populo Romano: simply=civibus, the burgesses, as opposed to the
socii and latini.

7 sociis et Latinis: these two words must be taken together as forming
one member of the enumeration, parallel with patribus conscm'ptr's and
populo Romam. When an enumeration consists only oi two members
Cicero, except in certain special cases, never omits the copula3 when
there are three or more members, he either puts et before each member
aiter the first or leaves it out altogether. In our passage, ii sociis and
Latinis had each of them been entitled to rank separately in the enume-
ration, it would have been necessary to strike out et. Madvig has most
thoroughly discussed this matter in a n. on Fin. 4, 56 and also in Opus·
cula 1, p. 333 sq. The practice ol most other writers oi the best period
agrees on the whole with that of Cicero in this respect. Cf. n. on 84‚L 5. ’

8 superos...deos...inseros: the word deos is purposely not placed im·
mediately aiter superos, in order to prevent the reader from under·
standing inferos to mean inferos deos. With this arrangement superos...

adas means, as Seyffert explains it, superi, qui dci sunt.
