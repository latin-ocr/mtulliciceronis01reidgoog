140 DE AMICITIA. [i 8³-

3² solitaria: cf. ἐς 30, 87, 88.

33 ea ¹quae summa sunt: ‘the highest moral views’3 cf. Arch. 14 illa
quae summa sunt...nilril esse in viia magno opere expetendum nisi laudem
atque honestatem, in ea autem persequenda omnis cmcroius corporat, om·
nia peribula martir atquc aexn'lz parvi esse ducenda.

P. Μ.

r altera: as virtm above=h0mo vz'rtute proditus so altera here=alte·
rius hominis maure. ef. virtutem in 48, l. ao.

quos inter: as a rule, only dissyllabic prepositions follow the cases to
which they are attached, erycept when some attribute is attached to the
illititill‘uantlt{titii<iiiiii itiiiriiyffiipihiii
only follows its case when it governs a relative prhnoun. Ρ

a torum etc: ‘theirs is to be regarded as the best and richest compa·
nionship on the path to nature's highest good'. For natura ci. 19 l. ao
naturam optimam bene vz'vendi ducem.

4 in quo omnia insunt: ‘which brings with it everything'.

5 honestus...iucunditas: the enumeration consists of three branches,
the last oi the three being subdivided (tranquillitas atque iucunditas).
Had iucunditas and tranquillitas occupied in the enumeration the same
place as the other two things mentioned, Cicero must have left out
atque. See n. on 12, p. 31, l. 7. For expetenda see n. on aa, l. 243
for the collocation tranquillitos animi atque iucunditas n. on 8, 1. aa

Ι cum summi viri lum amicissimi. Seyffert seems to think that homins

is not used here in its ordinary Ciceronian sense of ‘morality’, though
he does not say what meaning he gives it.

6 ut et...possit: this clause is one of the most difficult in the treatise,
though passed over by Nauck and Lahmeyer. It seems to contain a
tacit protest against the Stoic ethics which made honestas (τὸ καλὸν
:virtuel everything3 Laelius asserts that perfect happiness (for beata
vito ci. n. on 45, l. 25 beate nabendum) contains other things as well, and
that the erfection oi fiiendship and the perfectiori oi happiness are
inextricabiy connected.

7 meod: this refers back to the last sentence and not forwards to id.

11 ι gravis aliqui casus: aliquis, which is substantival, qliqyi being adjec-

experiri.- cf. ἐξ 53, 64. Seyffert quotes from Plutarch a saying of
Euripides τὸ φίλων πεῖραν λαβεῖν οὐ σμικρὸν κακόν, and from Stobaeus

one of Philemon εὔχου μὴ λαβεῖν πεῖραν φίλων.
