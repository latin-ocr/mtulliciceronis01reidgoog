5 perspe'eiuntur: see n. on 56, p. 45, l. 30 comtituendi ssent qui sint
fines; also on 35, l. aa.
quam sint leves: n. on 10, l. Squam id recte.

6 movere mn potuit: ‘could not have changed'. For this sense af
movere ('=de statu movere) cf. pro Scauro fragm. 45 quem purpura
regalis nan commovit, eum Sardorum mastruca mutavit?

· sin vero: arare combination os particles; Cic. nearly always says
se vero.

8 honores magistratus: not essentially different from imperia potestates,
sor which see 54, l. 18.

ro ins amicitiae: ‘the law oi friendship'.

11 imiecilla eta: ‘nature shews weakness when called on to renounce
power .

’ 13 obscuratum iri: ‘they think their fault will be sorgotten’ (ie. in ibe
blane of their prosperity).

§aa

16 vbi invenias: i.e. si quaeras (cf. n. on 5, l. 24) but above l..8 vbi
inveniemus ; with the future the search is looked on as likely to take
place, with the subjunctive, as not likely.

17 quid: n. on 50, 1, a.
haee ut omittam: observe the fondness of Cic. sor placing ut second

word in the clause or sentence. He nearly always says nihil ut, non ut,
sic ut and the like and not viee versa. Cf. 87, l. 4.

19 descendant: cf. descmdere in certamen, also in causam (Cic. Phil. 8,
4), and the similar uses with decurrere, devenire.

reete: the omission of a verbum dedendi is particularly common in
quotations3 so Off. a, 62 praeclare Ennius,· cf. also n. on 1, l. ra

21 levitatis et infirmitatis: ‘changefulness and instability’.

aa aut si...aut: the omission oi the second si is exceedin ly awkward,
and I have been able to find no parallel. Possibly cum ias fallen out
after the second aut; cf. Fin. a, 15 si aut...aut cum. Madvig in Fin.
1, 3 3 rejects aut ut...aut (where a second ut is needed) and reads ut aut
...aret as some here have proposed to read a· aut...aut.

contemnunt: sc. amicos.
