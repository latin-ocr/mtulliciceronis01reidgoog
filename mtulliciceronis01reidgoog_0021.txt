12 INTRODUCTJON

Laelius, who as a distinguished Roman general and states· ’
man, could not be allowed to go too deeply into philosophi-
cal questions. Besides this imitation of Theophrastus, one or
two direct imitations occur of a discourse of Socrates on
friendship recorded by Xenophon in his Memorabilia (2, 4-1o)¹.
Further, there is a slight reference in the prooemium to the
Theaetetus of Platot Beyond this no distinct adaptation of
Greek originals can be traced. It is extremely doubtful, or
perhaps more than doubtful, whether Cicero used in this treatise
the Nicomaeieeou E tlu'cs, though he knew os its existence ³, and
had perhaps, at some time, read it. Several resemblances be-
tween that work and portions os the Laelius can be accounted
ior by the fact that many of Aristotle's ethical utterances had
passed into commonplaces. It is exceedingly likely that Cicero
knew Plato’s Lysis, but 1 am unable to point out any distinct
imitation of it4. No doubt Cicero read and used here and there
other Greek treatises on Friendship, which we do not now
possess. ln ξ 45 Cicero adapts some lines os Euripides which
Plutarch says were commented on by Chrysippus in his work
περὶ φιλίας, but the verses were so notorious that there is no
reason to suspect imitation.

secondary title De amicitio,· see the passage in Laelius 5 ut
