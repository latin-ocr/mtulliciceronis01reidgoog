Appuwnsu ow THE raro: 157

a rs.

l. 18. qui: Putsche in Philologus rm, p. 300 proposes cui after
Gulielmius, which is adopted by H BL, Balso taking a suggestion of H
to change ut in to uti (ulei). It is inexplicable to me why all these
scholars should substitute by conjecture the very rare (if not unpa·
ralleted) ellipse of videbatur for the very common ellipse of the uerbum
dicendi. They should at least have gone on to insert vedebatur after
‚smtpea as Kayser suggested. '

1. αι. quaeruntur: B Lquam'tur with P only.

1023· mihi vero erit gratum: H B omit m't gratum (after Beier)
though the words are in all Mss. The omission is groundless, though

¹³ 11le 'faribertus edd. antevenit, a form which was distinctly

l. 33. duos: LN duo with P only. 1 believe, however, that the

1. 3. nil quicquam: five out of Halm's six Mss (including G) have

l. 30. itaque non aqua cta: Brieger, Beitriige zur Kritil( einiger philo·
sophischer Schriften des Cicero', Posen1873, p. 7 proposes sweeping
transpositions and other changes affecting this and the three succeeding
sentences, on the very insufficient ground that the proverb applies to
all friendships whereas Cicero professes to be speaking of perfect
friendship. y ,
pluribvs locis: so H with G; Β L N locis pluribus with P. Cf. 47,
p. 43, l. miultis locet. η

l. 13. ne agri quidem: all Mss have nec, but nec quidem isa

phrase not used by good writers; cf. n. on 30, p. 38, l. 4.

l. 15. percipi: so all mss, and the word makes vcry good sense,
percepere being very commonly used by Cicero with the meaning ‘to
