6 huiusfacta, illius dr'cta: for hic used to denote theone oftwo persons
who is nearer in time to the speaker, as compared with ille, the person who

· is more distant in time, see my n. on Arch5 16. In facta...dicta we
have the contrast between the life of action, the πρακτικός βίος, which
the Romans regarded as the only proper life for a man of rank, and the
literary or contemplative life, the θεωρητικὸς βίος. The Romans loolred
on all departments of thought and literature as graceful adjuncts to a
life of activity, but nothing more. Cf. ιι. on 16, l. 193 also on 88, L 29.

7 habetote: on this form of the imperative, erroneously called the
future imperative, though it differs not a whit in sense from the other
form, see my ιι. on Cic pro Balb05 173 cf. quaeritate iu 24, p. 36, l. a.

8 quam id recte: cio. loves to separate tam quam ita tantus quantus

, by some small word, from the words they quality. See my n. on

consider', viderint being not perfect subjunctive, but future perfect irr-
dicative. Phrases like this are carefully treated by Roby (Preface to Vol.
11, p. CVI and 5 1593), who has a very full list of examples.

moveor enim: Seyffert is right in supplying den'dcrio from the pre·
ceding sentence.

ιι confirmare: the sense is rather stronger than that of (firmare.
ra nuipre: cf. n. on 5, l. 28.

solacio: this, not solatio, is the right spelling.
13 marc: ‘delusion’.

quo decessu: for the juxtaposition of ablatives in different construc-
tions which seems to us an awkwardness, cf. my u. on pro Balbo 5 26.

14 nihil mali etc.: the same opinion is expounded at length in Tusc.
Disp, boolr 1. Cf. especially5 111 nostrum enim et nostra causa sus·
ceptum dolorem modice serre debemus ne nosmet ipsos amare videamur.
Illa suspicio intolerabili dolore cmriat, ri ‹pinamur eos quibus orbati
summ, esse cum alz‘quo sensu in eis nzalrr quibus volgo opinantur. See
also the reflexions ou the death of Hortensius iu Brut. 5 5, and Fam. 5,
16, quoted on 45, l. 25.

15. incommodis: the wordishere pointedly contrasted with mali. There
Ι rs no doubt a slight reference to the Stoic theory of προηγμένα and dro-
προηγμένα. Although only virtue is bonum, only vice malum in the
eyes-ofuthe Stoics, still there are such differences among other things
as wrll mcline the wise men to desire some of them (προηγμέναεειι-
menda) and reject others (ἁποπροηγμέναενιίείιηᾱα or incommoda), his
real happiness, however, remaining absolutely unaffected. See head,

1, 36 and 37, with my nn.
