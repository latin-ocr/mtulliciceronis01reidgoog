o PREFACE. ’

editors in the future must continue to build. I
have compared also my own notes throughout
with those contained in the editions by Nauck and
Lahmeyer. These editions- have proved not nearly
so usesul asv I expected from their very extensive
circulation' in Germany.¹ My debts to them are
aclrnowledgedr each· in its proper place, as are also my
obligations to N'agelsbach and other writers on the
Latin of Cicero. ·It may be well for meto state that
1 have no acquaintance with any English edition ol
the Laelius. :I only heard oi Mr Arthur Sidgwick’s
edition as forthcoming ata time when my own was
sar advancedssf¹ ·

I expectato have· finished by ·Easter next my
edition of the Cato maier (De Senectute). At that
point my series of editions of Cicero-’s works must
stop for⁴ a time· though 1 hope to add to it in future

years. ,
