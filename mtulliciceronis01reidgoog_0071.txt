62 DE AMICITIA. [51—

quoad possem et lateret: cf. Lucr. a, 850 quoad licet aa possin Cic.
Leg. agr. a, 19 quoad posset, quoad fas esset, quoad liceret.

5 a senas...discederem: au exaggerated expression, as in Balb. 5 accu-
sator fieretur hunc numquam a Memmio discessisse ; Liv. 37, 53, 18
numquam a consule abscessi.

6 ab ea...disputata.·¹ Cic. allows disputante govern an accusative of a
neuter pronoun only, in place of the usual constr„ viz. de with able so
in 24, p. 36, la, 16, lac. He is more free iubis use of the passive;

8 pmsdentia: this word usually implies not wisdom in general but slai'll
in some special subject; here Roman Law3 cf. psmdeas in iure in 6,

. a l. 1.
p riri...cantesli.· contrast this with a patre deductus eram above.

9 unum...praeslaatissimum: this emphatic use of sentes with the super-
lative is commonia Cic,e.g‚. Tusc. a, 643 4, 555 5, 66; so Verg.·
Aen. a, 426 cadit et Rhipeus iustissimus unus, and Homer, 11. ra, 243
ets atavis ἄριστος. For the gen. nostrae cim'tau's cf Tusc. 3, 81 unum
anemium maximum. The strengthening force of unus is also seen in the
common phrases quibis unm, quilibet unus, usius aliquis, umus quisque.

ιο sm de hoc alias: nune eta: the ellipse of the verb (datam) is commem
cf. Tusc. 3, losed idalias, nunc quad instat: ib. 3, 25 sed cetera alias:
manc...; ib. 3, 73 sed de leae alias, nune...; Balb. 1 ega qnantum ei debeam, “
alia loca; also below, 13, l. 183 64, l. 193 3²21· 30. Observe that in the
best writers alias is always equivalent to alia ienrpare, never to alia moda.
For redeo cf. De Or. a, 62 sed illuc redem· below, 96, l. aa ut ad me
redeam ; also 75, 1. aa.

rr cum saepe inulta, tum etc: there is a change of construction in this
sentence which leaves the clause cum saepe malta incomplete. Some·
thing like eum dicem must be supplied. Trans. ‘I remember much that ·
he said on many occasions, but particularly that ete) On the constr. of
memini Roby§ 1372 says ‘memini is used with the present (and some·
times the perfect) infinitive of events of which the subject himself was
witness, with the perfect infinitive of events oi which the subject was
‘not witness'. The rule may be somewhat more precisely stated thus.
If the person who recalls an event was a witness of it, he may either
(a) vivrdly picture to himself the event and its attendant circumstances
so that it becomes really present to his mind's eye for the moment, in
which case he uses the present infinitive, or (6) he may simply recall the
fact that the event did take place in past time, in which case the perfect
infinitive is used. If he was not a witness, he evidently can conceive
the event only in the latter. of these two ways. As regards (a) cf.
Verg. Ecl. 9, 5² langas cantanda pmsmm menaa‘ni me candere sales with
Georgo. e, 125 memini me Corycium vidisse senem. Examples like the

latter ostbese two are more numerous thanis commonly supposed.
