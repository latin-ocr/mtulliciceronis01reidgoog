pyrpylecspbtp anteibat might have been supposed to be Africanus, supplied

8 ut si qoam: the first ut introduces a clause explanatory of quad-‘all
must do this, I mean they must share ete.' Cf. 14, l. 27 id si ita est ut...
The second ut is consecutive.

9 ea: observe the change from the singular praestantiam to theplural
ea, and for similar changes seen. on 14, l. 16 quae.

10 orbati siryt: the subject is not proximi from proximis but mines from
amm usa ove.

si: note si followed by si, the suppositions being parallel, and not
contrasted with each other. Had they been contrasted sive-sive or si-
sin would have been needed. In one sentence in Livy (4, 5, 5) siis thus
eight times repeated.

11 imbecilliore animo oel fortuna: these are the persons mentioned in
59, l. 11 saepe enim in quibusdam aut anirnus abiectior est aut spes am-
plificandae fortunae fractior. ’

11 apes...dignitati: there is really chiasmus here (see 1101113, l. ιο) since
apes refers to fortuna, honori et dignitati to animo. If one's friend is
imbecillo animo (μικρόψυχος), thinking meanly of himself, one must try
to confer distinction on him; if he is poor, wealth.

honori: n. on 13, 1. 16 cordi.

fistulis : ‘legends’‚ such as that of Romulus and Remus, to which the
words deorum-pastores rather point. Seyffert perversely insists on
taking the word here and in 75, l. 11 as meaning ‘plays’.

only other passages in good prose where ignorantia occurs are Caes.
B.C. 3, 68, 1 and Nep. Ages. 8, 53 Pelop. 1, 1.

stirpis et generis: ‘stock and family’; the only difference being that

stirpis is the wider word of the two. How slight *the difference is may Ἴ

be seen from the following passages: Verg. Aen. 4, 611 stirpem otgerius

anina futurarm exercete odiis ,· ib. 8, 618 illic genus amne suturae stirpis

· ab Ascania· ib. 9, 603 durum ab stirpe genus; Seneca Oedip. 124

stirpis invictae geraus interimam Attius 208 (Ribbeck) summum peri·
elum contaminari stirpem aa aresceri genus.

ra, famulatu :=0nrela, free service, as opposed to iaoleip=seroitata

15 quos: here=eum eas, ‘irrasmuch as for many years they looked on'
them as their fathers’; so often; e. g. in 50, l. 11 quae=cum ea.
