PREFATORY NOTE.

Iu what oonoerns the text oi this edition ot the
de Amicitia I desire to aeknowledge gratetully my
obligations to Dr J. S. Reid. I have purposely
abstained from consulting his explanatory noteS,
feeling that they were too recent to be the common
prey of Editors; although Ι know how muoh I might
have gained from them. I have consulted throughout
0. F. Miiller's edition of Seyffert's bulky commentary,
and frequently the notes in Nauok'e edition 3 and
sparingly (for a reason similar to that which kept me
from Dr Reid's book) the notes of Mr A. Sidgwiok.

I have tried, with what success I cannot say, by a
running analysis to shew a boy that there ia some
meaning in what he reads, and that Oioero did not
write merely to puzzle English sohoolboys ; and by a
Biographiool Index, somewhat fuller than usual, I
have aimed at rousing some interest in the persons
alluded to in the text. I have plaoed the analysis
with the text, ae I have done in other books of mine,
because my experiente as a Sohoolmaster has taught
me that what is relegated to Prefaoe or Appendix has
little ehanee oi being read at all

Arum, 1885.
