De republica (the characters in which are nearly all mentioned
in the Laelius), in 52 the De legibus, all three works on a large
scale, and entitled to rank as philosophical, according to ancient
ideas¹. All of them shew his continued acquaintance with the
discussions current in his time of problems which would now
be recognised as belonging to philosophy.

¹From 51 to 46 Bm owing first to his absence in Cilicia, then
to the civil troubles, Cicero almost ce‘ased to write. But in the
latter year he was reconciled with Caesar, and as the senate and
law courts were closed against him on his resusal to com·'
promise his political principles, he betook himself with greater
devotion than ever to literature. He began to carry out a great
plan for interpreting the best philosophical writings of the
Greeks to his cultivated fellow-countrymen. Idleness he felt to
be absolutely unendurable and it‘ seemed to him that he could
do his country no better service than by conferring on it a
philosophica] literature of its own. Hitherto those Romans who
had studied philosophy at all had studied it in Greek. The only
Latin philosophical literature was Epicurean, and putting aside
the poem of Lucretius, which had scarcely then become famous,
consisted entirely of books mdely written, which had however
attained a large circulationl.

Cicero made no claim to originality as a philosopher, or even
toan entire and complete acquaintance with every detail of the
Greek systems³. His usual plan was to take one or two leading
Greek works on the subject with which he was dealing, and to
represent sreely in his own language their subject-matter, intro·
ducing episodes and illustrations of his own. We shall presently

see how this general ‘'plan was carried out in the case of the
