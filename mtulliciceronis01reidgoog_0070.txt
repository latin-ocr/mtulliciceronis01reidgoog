, ι memoriter: not ‘by heart’ or ‘from memory’ but ‘with good me·

mory,' like μνημονικῶς (Xen. Cyr. 5, 3, 46). Madvig is right in saying

nec dubitare: :et (solebat) non dubitare. When dubitare means to

another construction, viz. quin with subj. More examples of this usage
occur in Cic. than in any other author: eg. Leg. agr. a, 69 et vos non
dubitatis quin vectigalia vestra vendatis. In a positive sentence the infin·
itive is unusual: cf. Sall. Cat. 15, aea illi neeben dubita& Cic. N. D. 1,
113 acoesat fratrem suum quod dubitet omnia vaetre mota.

t'rom the toga praetexta (sometimes called merely praetexta) the purple
bordered robe worn at Rome by magistrates and children. The toga
oi the ordinary adult citizen was not dyed. The toga vin'le's was gene·
mlly assumed at the beginning of the seventeenth year. For oirilis tago
