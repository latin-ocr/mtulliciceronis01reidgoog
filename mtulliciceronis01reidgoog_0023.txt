14 INTRODUCTION

logues one person, Socrates, is overwhelmingly prominent, but
he constantly endeavours to drag the other personages into the
discussion. Cicero, in most of his philosophical works (the
T usculan Disputations forms an exception more apparent than
real) avoids the quick interchange of question and answer which
is characteristic of Plato. Aristotle’s dialogues1 were more
popular too than those of Plato, and therefore suited Cicero's
purpose better ; moreover‚ the style of Aristotle had been imita-
ted by many writers, Theophrastus and others, down to Cicero’s
time, while the Platonic style had hardly met with any imita-
tors.

e. T loe interlocutum in the dialogor. The chief speaker is
ans LAELIUS, the friend of the younger Africanus (not to be
confounded with his father C. Laelius, the friend of the elder
Africanus). This distinguished statesman, soldier, and man of
letters was born about 186 13.c., was plebeian tribune in 151 (see
below, p. 15, n. 5); performed heroic exploits as an officer of
Scipio in the Third Punic War3 was praetor in 145², and com-
manded an army against Viriathus with success ; in 141 failed
as a candidate for the consulship, though supported by Scipiol,
but in 140 succeeded. He also held the office of augur‘. During
the greater part of his life he was a strong supporter of the
aristocratic party, and towards the end of it stoutly opposed the
η schemes of Ti. Gracchus and those of his partisans after his

death⁵.

Laelius was not only one of the greatest patrons of literature
Rome ever saw, but was himself a man of high culture, and
great ability as a speaker and writer. ¹He was widely read in
philosophy, particularly the Stoic His Latin style was so good
that the plays of his friend Terence, admired for the purity of
their Latinity, were by many ascribed in whole urin part to
himl. Some of his speeches were extant in Cicero’s time, and
were, on the whole, admired by him⁷.
