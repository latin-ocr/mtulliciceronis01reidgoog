aa ΒΕ AMICITIA. [ἓ 6-

prndens in inre: Seyffert rightly points out that Cic. does not use
pncdcns with a genitive. He might have added that the phrase iuni
praedans (sor iurisperitus or consultus) is not Latin, though iuris prudentia
occurs, as in De Or. r, e 56, and though jurisconsults are styled pru·
dentes. Cic. has imprudens with gen. in De inv. a, 95, also prudens ad in ¹
pro Font. 433 and pncdenteiz osten both with gen. and with in and abl.

a multarum rerum usum: ‘amanifoldexperience’. Liv. 39, 4o‚4 says
of him nulla ors neque menatae neque publicae rei gerendae ci defuit.

3 habebat et multo: lor the reading see Appendix. There is a change
of construction in the sentence3 the clause from Acilius to putabatur
requires to be completed by supplying something like ergo appellatus
est sopiens, while the clauses from Cato to ferebantur, which are parallel
t'o the former clause, have their sense actually completed by the words
from propterca to sopientes.

multo eius...fercbantur.· ‘many instances whdre both in the senate and
the forum he displayed either wise foresight, or firm conduct, or shrewd·
ness in reply‚ were on every tongue '. The chief reference in responsa is
'to Cato's same as a lawyer. According to old Roman custom he sat at
home in the early morning, on purpose to resolve the legal difficulties of
all who chose to consult him. This was technically called ius respondere.

5 quasi: ‘almost’; cf. n. on quasi, 3, p. 28, l. a.
iam: i.e. even before his death.
sapienta: observe this difference between Latin and English idiom3

the Latins always say nomen institiae, vox fortitudinis, appellatio pmodentis
etc. where we use a position-‘the name justice ', ‘the word courage',

‘the title skilful’. 92, 1. 30 nomen amicitiae and for the sense Cat.

, m. 5 (where Cato is speaking) sapientiam meam admirari soletis—quae
utinam de'gno esset opinione vestra nostroque cognomine! Note that the
same term cognomen is applied to the inherited third name Cato and to
the acquired name sapiae. In late Latin agnomen was applied to the
latter to mark the distinction.

§h

6 te autem...esse sapientem: this clause was really intended to depend
on existimant below, l. 13, but owing to the great length of the sentence
Cic. made a pause at iudicatum, and repeated the gist of the sentence down
to that point in the words hom...sapientiom, which are actually made to
depend on exanimant. The sentence is an example of change of con·
struction or anacoluthza.

non solum...docieina: here notura denotes the intellectual endowments
with which a man is born, and mores his natural character3 ci. 7, 1. 7 3
27, p. 37, l. 7. Studium or devotion to the pursuit ol learning depends
on mores, doctm'no or attainment on this combined with natura. The
two words natura and mores together comprise the whole natural cadmo-
ments of a man, while studium and doctm'na indicate his aequirements.
Lahmeyer says that notura corresponds to studio and moribus to doctrina,
but me mllowing passage will prove him to be wronge Academica r.
