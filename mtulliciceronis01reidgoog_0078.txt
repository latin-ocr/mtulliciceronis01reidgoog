ao naturae celeritatem ad dz'scenelum et mensorium dabam ....... manem
autem putabant studia esse. Cf. also (with my notes on the passage)
Arch. 15 ego ntultos homines excellenti animo ac virtute fuisse et sine ’
doctri na naturae ipsius habitu...gravis exstitisse sirteor etc.‚ and Verg.
Georg. 4, 5 mores et studia. Studio et doctrino is not an instance of
ἓν διὰ δυοῖν, and should not be translated ‘by aeal sor learning’, but
‘by devotion and culture'3 cf. Arch. 5 otium ae studium ,· De Or. 1,
aa otio studioque.

9 relziyna: this word is proleptic or anticipative, since its sense is not
sully seen till we come to Athenis which completes the contrast. So
ceteras is often used and λοιπὸς, ἄλλος in Greek3 cf. 16, l.21 ceteris ,⁰
aa, 1. 24 ceterae; 54, l. 17 antea ,· 41, l. 18 deinde ,¹ 55, l. at cetera.

· septem: ‘the seven’, sapientes beingunderstood‚ asin 59, p. 46, l. 3²·
’ So x11 alone often stands for xit tabulae (Leg. a, 59, 60), and Asinius
Pollio has lin Cic. Fam. ro, 5ο, a) xiv for xlv ordines.

10 subtilius: ‘with more than usual accuracy’. Subtilis is often the
exact equivalent of the Greek ἀκριβής.

non tabent: Cic. in Off. 3, 16 denies the title sapiens not only to the

’ seven, but to Cato and to Laelius himself.

11 unuin: emphatic: ‘one only ’. Cic. nearly always leaves the English

‘only' unexpressed, but occasionally he uses nendo, and once (Acad. a, 74)
Ι tantum, the occurrence of which Seyffert on this passage wrongly denies.

etcum quidem: these words really belong to and add emphasis to
η sapientissimum cf. 4, l. 16 et eorum,· 38, l. ²3 eteorum quidem. ·

Apollines...iudicatum: Socrates in Plato‘s Apology p. at Α merely
says that the oracle declared that no one was wiser than himself (μηδένα
σοφώτερον εἶναι). The person who put the enquiry to the oracle, Chae·
rephon, a pupil of Socrates, was dead when the trial took place, but his
brother bore evidence to the facts. Xenophon in his Apology§ 14 (is it
be his) makes Socrates speak more definitely about the oracles-a’seileei
Ἀπόλλων μηδένα εἶναι ἀνθρώπων ἐμοῦ μήτε ἐλευθεριώτερον μήτε δικαιότερον
μήτε σωφρονέστερον. In another part of the Apology by Plato (33 c)
Socrates says that the life he followed had been enjoined on him by the
Delphian god καὶ ἐκ μαντείων καὶ ἐξ ἐνυπνίων. The Scholiast on Aris-

* tophanes' Nubes 114 gives there the actual words of the answer to
Chaerephon: σοφὸς Σοφοκλῆς, σοφώτερος δ’ Εὐ talias, carpentanorum
Σωκράτης σοφώτερος. The latter of the two lines is also preserved by
Diogenes Laertius 2, 5, 337. Cic. speaks in sour other passages of the
creole, viz. Laet 10 and 13, Cat. m. 78, Academ. 1, 16.

People were curious to see whether Laelius would try to carry out his
philosophy,¹ and to appear careless about the death of his friend. For

14 virtute e'nfeeiores: ‘of less importance than virtue ’- This Qec uxe-
ceding n.) is not strong enough to express the Stoic uestem.
