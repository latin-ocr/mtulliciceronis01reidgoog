concedant ut : when concedere means to give permisrian to dasame-
thing it regularly takes ut with subjunctive, but when it means ta admit
a fact it is regularly followed by the accusative with infinitive. The
subjoined passage shews the distinction3 Rosc. Am. 54 comedenti ut ea
praetereas quae, cnm taces, nulla esse concedis. Sometimes, however,
Cicero substitutes the subjunctive construction for the infinitive (but not
uice versa) as in our passage and F in. 5, 78 si Stoicis concedis ut uirtus
sola uitam efficiat beatam. In such passages the effect ol the admission is
rather looked to than the admission itsell. The meaning here is ‘let them
mate such an admission as to bring it about that these were good men'.
