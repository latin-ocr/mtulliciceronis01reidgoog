realise the fact that C. is an abbreviation ior strue, not entus the latter
form of the name having been absolutely unknown to the Romans oi the

and occasionally in R. Ellis’ Catullus ; so Kiihner, Graux. 1, ed. a, p. 708
⁶0. oder G. Gaiurs’). But the Romans always wrote C. not G. In very
carly times the Latin alphabet contained no letter G, and the letter C re·
presented two distinct sounds, the guttural tenuis and the guttural media.

introduction to Plato's Theaetetus, p. 142 (a dialogus Cic. imitates
elsewhere, as in De Or. 3, 473 Tusc. 1, 8), where Euclides says with
regard to the subject-matter of that dialogue ἐγραψάμην δὲ δὴ οὑτωσὶ
