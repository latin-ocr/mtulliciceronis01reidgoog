is assigned to this us by Baiter, Lahmeyer and others. My judgment
upon the existing evidence is that their estimate is exaggerated. P has
peculiar errors ol its own, and there is a most singular agreement in
many places between it and Halm's D (‘codex Vindobonensis saec. xv')

which any one who reads Halm’s critical notes will see to be so grossly
corrupt as to be practically worthless.

Ol M we have still less informatam-nothing indeed beyond the
readings Baiter gives from a collat‘ion by Karl Halm. While I have
carefully weighed th'e MSS evidence on every point, even the minutest‚
the general result has been that when any two of these three MSS, viz.

M GP, are agreed Ihave adop ed the reading, while 1 have seldom ,

found it necessary to talre a reading given by any one estham, when
unsupported by other evidence. Very rarely haveI hadt to depart from
the consmsus of the three. These three MSS give an unusually sound
basis for the text os the Laelius. ⁶ Ἰ ¹

Baiter's text is denoted by B, Halm’s by H, Lahmeyer’s by L (Ι have
used the third edition), Nauck’s by N (seventh edition). The readings
Ι have selected here for comment are chiefly those which, illustrate points
os grammar, syntax, or orthography. '

l. 14. fere multis: some scholars have wished to strike out mutat as
a gloss, Cic. certainly would not qualisy multis by the addit' tion offere
but fere rs obe taken with tum, not with multis The writer of one ol
Halm's MSS (D) felt the difficulty, and changed multti' rnto omnibus. y

l. 15. utebare: some MSS have atelani, but although' 1n the second
person singular of the present indicative deponent and passive Cicero
commonly uses the sorm' m -ris, he ostener has the form rn -re rn the
second person singular of the imperfect (indicative and subjunctive] and
of the future passive.

l. ao. laeli: Ι have everywhere written single i in the genitives os
nouns whose nominatives end in ius, ium, from a conviction that Cicero
