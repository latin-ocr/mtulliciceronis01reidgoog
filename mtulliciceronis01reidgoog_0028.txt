¹ brothers death, but no modern scholar of any rank has coun-
tenanced the susffcion.

1 proceed to speak of some other friends of Scipio who are

¹ mentioned in our dialogue. Chies of these is L. Furius Philus1,
consul of the year 136, a man os great knowledffe, aad high
character, and a friend and patron of Greek literati. He is
thought worthy by Cicero to rank beside Cato and Laeliusl, and
isone of the interlocutors in the De re publica.
y P. Rupilius was consul in 1-32 and exercised great severity
against the partisans of Ti. Gracchus. His consulship is said
to have been due to the aid of Scipiol. He commanded in
Sicily against the insurgent slaves and established a code of
laws t'or the administration ol that province.

Μ’, Manilius⁴, consul in 149, commanded in Africa for some,
time against the Carthaginians with Scipio as one of his officers.
He was a very eminent lawyer, and a close friend of Laelius and
Scipio, appearing in the De republica along with them.

¹ Spurius Mummiuss’ seems to have been a very different man
from his brother the destroyer of Corinth. He had both wit
and literary ability, which recommended him to the very in-
timate friendship of Scipio, with whom he is joined in Cicero’s
De republica. When, to secure Scipio's safety, the senate
dispatched him on an embassy to Asia, Mummius was his
companion. Mummius spent some time in Achaia as legatus
to his brother and thence sent witty epistles in verse to his

. friends at homet. Apparently he was unpopularand unsuccess-
sulas a politician and devoted himself to study, becoming a
strong Stoic. We hear of him that he was particularly noted
sor his detestation os the teachers os Rhetoric.
