156 APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXT.

5⁵·

l. 28. te ipse: so P L N; but H B with G and some inferior uss
have te aprum. Phrases like te ipse are so much commoner in Cicero
than those like te a'psum, and the former are so easily and so osten

corrupted into the latter, that I bave followed the reading of P. Α

l. 3. habebatet multa: 1 have inserted et on my own conjecture.
Without it Cata is one of the subjects to the verb putabatur ; with it, is
subject to the verb habebat below, propterea repeating quia, owing to the
length of the sentence. With the old reading a long stop was needed
altar lugebat, another aster serebantur, and the transitione were most
aw war.

§¹1-

l. 8. volgus: so B, but H L N augeas. It is almost certain that
Cicero wrote walgras, volt and the like.

l. 9. Graeceio reliqua: so H with G and other Mss3 B L N relapua
Graecia with P D only.

H Ι13. 13]. ἰἷῇιιίείίε so LN rightly (the Latins objected to df, bs) but
a ms ι.

Ι. 3. Gallum: all the mss here have Gaium ,⁰ so in ar, 1. 14 Gaias,
bnt in ποι, 1. ao gallum. Since Galus is occasionally found lor Gallus,
fflpyrgnsen and aster him B L N write the name with one lin all three

51⁰.
l. 7. vestrum: omitted by B L N with P D only.

511.

l. ar. consul: bracketedby B H L, though in all MSS. ef. how·
ever my n. On this principle many other words in the dialogue would
kaygutobebraclreted or ejected; e. g. sapientem iu 7, l. 85 capelades in 18,

l. 27. omnis.- Ihave written everywhere inot ein the accusative
plural masc. and sem. ol nouns whose genitive plural ends in aum.
Though Cicero's usage may have varied, be probably wrote the -ἰ in
the vast majority of instances.

512.

l 32. etiam nunc: H commends without adopting the conjecture
of Victorius, tunc. See, however, my n.
