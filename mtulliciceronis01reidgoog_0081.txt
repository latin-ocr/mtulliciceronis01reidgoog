Ι, ait videris: for the personal construction taking the issaoe of the

impersonal ut miletae cf. Att. 5, 18, a consiliis, ut mannae, onis utimur.

perfecto: this seems here merely to mean ‘adult’ in opposition to
pueris. Iknow no parallel to this use, but there are good reasons for
not taking perfectae in the moral sense which our word ‘perfect’ has.

fictus vir in this sense. (a) The meaning ‘perfect'would make per·
stato et spectato a inrepat πρότερον.
