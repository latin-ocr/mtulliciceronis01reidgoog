ἓ 30] NOTES. ¹99

Africanus indigens: the σοφὸς or sapiens of the Stoic system aa
αὐτάρκης, sufficient for himself. Chrysippus (Seneca Ep. 9) drewa
fine distinction, that there was nothing the wise man needed, though
there were many things it was advisable for him to have—nulla re
indigere et tamen roraltis illi retus opus csse. Cf. Plato, Lysis 215 B
πῶς οὖν ol α’γαθοί τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ἡμῖν φίλοι ἔσονται τὴν ἀρχήν, ol urire
ἀπόντες τοθεινοὶ ἀλλήλοις, traval γὰρ ἑαυτοῖς καὶ χωρὶς lieres, μήτε παρόντες
χρείαν αὐτῶν ἔχουσι; ·

Α ircdrgcns: the omission both of an interrogative particle and of erat
renders the question more emphatic. For the latter omission cf. n. ou
ar, 1. ro quid dulcius ,⁰ for the former De Or. a, 276 qnid? ega non
cognosco vacem tuom?

4 ac...ne...quidem cta: ‘and assuredly neither was 1 in need of him’.
Ac oratque at the outset of a sentence often introduces a statement em-
phatically. Observe that Cic. and the other writers of the best period
never use nec...quidem, the place of which is often taken by ac, or ct,
or atque followed by ne...quidcm.

5 egos sc. dilexi to be supplied from dilexit. Cf. ΡᾙίΙ. a, 38 sedet
{gologlmcsssr’lllc ιζ contra alle qued ego sentirem ct spectarem, vsaetm also

virtutis eires: the use of a genitive dependent on another fs com·
monest in Cic. when, as here, the dependent genitive is a pronoun.

Cf. 37, 1. 12 iltiusfuroris.

opirrione...lrnbebat: for the somewhat roundabout mode of expression
cf. Att. 7, a, 5 crat (epistula) dc republica, de opinione quam is air lrabe-
ret integritatis eneae: de benevolentia quam ostendit eo sermone quem
tabuit dc triumpho.

6 sortasse non ncilla: remark the show of modesty.

habebat...dilexit: the change of tense should be observed; the im·
perfect denotes that Africanus was some time in coming to his conclu·
{lffdlcsnabout Laelius ; dilexit points to the moment his decrsron took

Ι8 mccltae et magnac: when two adjectives are in agreement with the
same noun Cic. generally connects thern with ct, where English idiom
would often require them to be put side by side. When multus isone
of two adjectives the conjunction is rarely left out (cf. Greek usage-
πολλὰ καὶ rard), but if multaris one of tlsree adjectives the et some·
times disappears. Cf. Verr. 5, ¹¹9 nsulti et graves dolores, but Fam. 5,
17, 3 ocultis fortissimis atque optimis m'ris: Pro imp. Cn. Pomp. 6
nertlta...magna ct gravio tetta. Cf. however below, 49, l. 30 maltis in-
anibus; 54, l. ια multorum praepotentium.

9 causac diligendi: asomewhat pleonastic phrase; it would have been
enough to say that love (not the causes of love) starts from hope. Cf.
however Fin. 1, 42 rerum gerendarum initia proficiscuntur a volup·
tolie {att a ΞρΙονιῖ ἦραίΗὶεῐ. tr, 39' initio caedis orto; liv. aas 'satu (ὼ
