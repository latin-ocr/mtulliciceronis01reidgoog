In 1861 Halm published (in Vol. 1v of the revision os Orelli’s

edition of Cicero's works, continued by Baiter and Halm) 2 text of the
Laelios based on a collation of the readings of six Mss. Much the best
of these is the codex Gudianus, now at Wolfenbiittel, written in the xth
century. This Halm marks G. Since his edition appeared two other
M'ss of equal—some would say of superior—authority have come to
light, both of which were used by Baiter in revising the Laelius for the
edition of Cicero’s worlrs brought out by himself and Kayser in 1863 and
1864. One of these two Mss is in 2 private library at Paris, and was
first descrIbed by Th. Mommsen in the Rheinisches Museum, 1863,
p. 594 sq. It belongs to the end of the 1xth or beginning of the xth
century, and is commonly known as Codex Parisinus, and denoted by
P. There are two lacunae, one aster the word magnos in 5 75 to the
word etaiam in5 783 the other from peccasse in 5 90 to de Scipione in
5 96. The other MS is at Munich. lt also belongs to the xth century,
and is known as codex Monacensis, being denoted by M. It has lost the
part containing the first ten chapters.

Unfortunately‚ the information at hand concerning P and M is sar
from sufficient to enable us to determine their real value. We possess
only an incomplete collation of P by Mommsen, which leaves the read.
