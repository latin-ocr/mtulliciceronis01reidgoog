6 uestra causa: many editions have nostri, and in the last edition ol
N'agelsbach's Stilistik p. 506 the passage isstill quoted with nostri. Cic.
however never says mei tui sui uastm' uestri causa, but always mea causa
etc. The only passage in which the genitive is still retained hy recent
editors is Verr. 5, 121 sui causa, and many scholam, with whom 1 agree,

think that sua should be read there. ef. Madvig on Fin. 2, 76.

causa amicarum: note the chiasmus in nostra causa...causa amicarum,
and cf. 5 5, l. 21. The repetition ol causa (which is osten left out in the
second place, as in 46, l. 29) isno doubt due to the desire to complete
the chiasmus (ior which see n. on 23, l. 10).

11 uiri boui eta: it will be seen that in this section Cicero gives a
peculiar turn to the meaning oi the first opinion oi the three above
enumerated. He takes it to imply that a man must always act with
regard to his friend just as he would in his own case, but the opinion
itseli probably had regard not to action but to seehng and implied that

· lave between friends should be equal. It is in this sense that Cic.
himself understands the opinion in Tusc. 3, 73 praeclarum illud est

³ et, ,si quaeris, rectum quaque et uerum ut eosqui uobis carissimi esse
debeant aeque ac uasruet ipsas autemus. The opinion in lact was an
answer to the question drscussed by Aristotle 1n Eth. Nic. 9, c. 8
πότερον δεῖ φιλεῖν ἑαυτὸν μάλιστα ἤ ἄλλον rud and in the words of
the next clause it definiebat amicitiam pambus uoluntatibus.
