the same year Cicero completed several oratorical works, all
extant, the partitiones oratoriae, the Brutus or Da clani orato·
ribus, and the Orator.

In the beginning oi 43 Cicero lost his beloved daughter

Tullia. He passed the whole year in retirement, trying to soothe
his grief by incessant writing. In quick succession came the
De consolatione, an attempt to apply philosophy to the mitiga·
tlon of his own sorrow and that of others3 the Academica, an
exposition of the New Academia philosophy, advocating proba-
bility as the foundation of philosophy rather than certainty ; the
Desinibus botrorum etmalorum, a work criticising the chiefviews
entertained concerning ethics; the Disputationes Tusculanae,
treatingofcertainconditionsnecessarytohappinessandmorality;
the De natura deorum, a work whose contents are sufficiently
indicated by its title3 the De divinatione, a discussion ol the
’ question whether the gods communicate with mankind by
augury and the like3 the Cato rsiaior or De senectute; the
Laelius or De arnicitia,· the Dasato, discussing Fate and Free
Will; the Parodana, in which certain paradoxical opinions oi
,the Stoics were set forth3 the Da officiis, a work on the
practical application oi moral principles to ordinary life. All
these works are still extant, and were written almost entirely in
the years 45 and 44. To the list must be added other workS,
of a rhetorical nature, such as the Topica and the De optimo
garrera· dicendi, and some lost philosophical books, such as that
Degloria.

The mental vigour and literarypower exhibited by this series
of works appears prodigiam, when we consider their immense
compass and variety and the generallyhigh finish of their style,
even though allowance be made sor the fact that Cicero was
giving in Latin the substance of Greek books with which he had
been familiar from boyhood. In Cicero's Latin has lived a
large portion of the post-Aristotelian philosophy, which was
doomed to oblivion in the original Greek.

Itis necessary, before we leave the general subjectos Cicero’s
philosophical works, to state very briefly his philosophical views.
Cicero called himself an adherent oi the New troadem. xx.
