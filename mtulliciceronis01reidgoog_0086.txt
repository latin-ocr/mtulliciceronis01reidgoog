Peripatetics and also some of the New Academias held or at least some-
times advocated the same views.

13 mortuas...e'ura.· the principal ‘reverent rites’ paid to the dead are
mentioned in Cic. Leg. a, 55 sq.; cf. especially 57 multa relegiasa iura.
Our passage has also much resemblance to T uso. 1, 26 sq.

14 si...arbitrareutur.· cf. Tusc. 1, 27 caerimonias quas maximis ingenitis
praediti nec tanta cura coluissent... uisi haereret in eorum mentibus
mortem nan interitum esse omnia tollentun atque delentem sed quandam

uari migraturum. Observe the tense of arbitrarentur and haereret,
lor which modern feeling would* require the pluperfect. Cic. realises the
past (for the moment) as present, and so looks on the condition as not
wholly past but still continuing. The usage is in fact similar to the substi-
tution of the present for the past (for the sake of vividness) in historical
narratives· Often tou protasis and apodosis contain a verb in the
imperfect where we should expect the pluperfect (ag. Verr. 5, 893 Sest.
63l; but it does not often happen that the apodosis has averb in the plu·
perfect, while the verb in the protasis stands in the imperfect, as in Cat.
m. 19 eonsilium ratio sententia nisi essent in senibus, non summum
consutum maiores nostri appellassent senatum. Irregularities of the
same sort are commonia Greek conditional sentences.

17 institutis et praeceptis: ‘practices and injunctions'.

Pytlhagorean's and to Socrates as authorities for the immortality ol the

both sides of every question, and declared that certainty was unattain·
