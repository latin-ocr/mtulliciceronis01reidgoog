Cicero everywhere speaks in the most eulogistic terms of
Laelius’ character. All authorities were unanimous as to his
unswerving rectitude². His sslf-control and moderatiori were
remarkable². Like Socrates, he never shewed in his sace

throughout life the effect produced on his mind hy changes of ι

fortune³. His gentleness and affability were great⁴. His cheer·
fulness and humourousness were famous⁶.

, During his lile and aster his death Laelius bore the title
‚rapiens or ‘the wise⁶‚' a title which implies more of practical
than intellectual wisdom, though it would not have been given
to any one who was destitute oi culture and literary excellence.
·Altogether Laelius is Cicero's typica] example of the best results
of cultivation acting on a character which exhibited in their
fullest extent the ideal Roman virtues. He is introduced as an

interlocutor into two other dialogues‚ the Cato nzaior (De senec-
tute) and the De republica (along with Scipio, Fannius, and

scaih3airiendship of Laelius and Scipio was one of the most

famous in antiquity. Laelius, says Cicero, reverenced Scipio as
a god; Scipio looked up to Laelius (his senior) as a parent⁷.
The views of friendship which Laelius gives in the dialogue are
said by him to be mainly those oi Scipio.

' The other interlocutors are the two sons-in-law of Laelius,
Q Mucius Scaevola⁸ and Gaius Fannius. Scaevola belonged
to aiamily oi lawyers⁹‚ and was himself exceedingly distinguished
sor his knowledge of the law. He was horn about 157 and
