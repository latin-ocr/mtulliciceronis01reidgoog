a partiens commendans : the two participles differ very little in
meaning-oo marewidey than ‘diffini' and ‘sharing’ in English,

3 commoditates: very little differentia sense from opportunitates in
aa, l. ιγ. Opportunitas expresses rather the idea ol exce tional ap·

cum contiueat...tum praestat: the normal construction with cum
...tum is ior both choses to have the same verb or ior the verbs (ii
different) in both clauses to be in the same moad and tense. The
reason sor the variation here is the desire to point out that the fact
contained in the clause cum...contiueat isone which has been already
mentioned and disposed of. ‘Sces'ng that friendship furnishes very many
and important advantages...’. Continet would have been appropriate had
the fact now been mentioned ior the first time.

4 illa...praestat omnibus: 1 take illa as ablative (sc. commoditate), com·
paring 19, l. 26 looc praestat, and make omuibus neuter=omnibus rebam,

¹ the verbs praestat and praelucet having thus the same subject amcmtta.
Many editors, in order to avoid the exceptione! omnilus=omuibus
relus, make illa (sc. commoditas) subject to praestat so that omnibus ,
=o. commoditatibus, while praelucet has sor its subject amicitia. The
neuter omuibus used as substantive, though rare, is well attested3 cf.
N. D. a, 36 quae quomam talis cst ut et praesit omnebus et eam nulla
res possit impedire; ib. a. [33 ratio est enim quae praestet arnaldum
De lato 14 raon ualere uiduur in oocnibuss Liv. r, 45soruotts maselum
3, ο3 omissis omnibus; ci. also n. on 50, l 7 stasilium.

pem praelucet: the verb praelucere is rare even in poetry and very
rare in prose. The¹ transitive use (‘holds up the light of hope ’y
may perhaps be allowed here, though the only passages quoted sor ’
it by the editors and lexica are huson. ldyll. 4, 95 (p. luoun), and
Plaut. Casina 1, 3ο (p. facem). Plin. Nat. Hist. 3ο, 141 has praeluceat
baculum, ie. ‘sets on fire’. The only other passage I have noted is in
= Amm. Marc. 18, 6, r 5 p. facem.

5 cadere: cf. the phrase cadere cnloco.

6 ucmcm anticum: so 54, l. rs the word uerus is to be taken in aleas
strict sense than in aa, p. 34, l. 3² arra amicita.

exemplar aliquod: Seyffert well quotes the Μεγάλο ἠθικὰ a, 15
ὥσπερ οταν θέλωμεν αὐτοὶ αὐτῶν τὸ πρόσωπον idcir, εἱς vd stampas
ἐμβλέψαντες εἴδομεν, ὁμοίως xal ὅταν airoi αὐτούς βουληθῶμεν Ιγνῶναι,
