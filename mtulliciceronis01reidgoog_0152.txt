siquidem: ‘inasmuch as'.
4 iu fraudem impelletur: ‘is driven on to destruction'. Fraus often
means, as here, ‘harm’, ‘injury’.
5 habenda eta: Cicero says both habere rationem and adhibere ra·

nou modo...sed ue quidem: Cic. also uses uon modo uon...sed ue

uon modo cannot stand 101 nou modo non except when a negative follows.

rendered permissible by the proximity 01 amico, but the phrase libero
