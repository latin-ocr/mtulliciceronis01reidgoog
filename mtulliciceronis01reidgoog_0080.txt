rr mern snmmtairi tam arree’crlssimis' the natural order would have been
viri cum summi tam amicissimi. Α word however which (like atri here)
stands in the same relation towards two other 'words or phrases, is 'often
placed thus between the two. The old grammarians called this usage
coniunctio ; cf. Comifrcius Ad Herennium 4, 38 coniunctio est cum in·
terposr'tr'one verbi et,superiores orationis partes comprehendantur et
infertores, doc enoda: Formae degnr'tas aut morbo deflorescit aut vetustate ,·

23 moderate: the Stoics, whom Laelius followed, declared all emotion
viciam, aud therefore not to be entertained hythe philosopher either to
a moderate or to an immoderate extent; see Tusa, book ιν, particu-
larly ὅ 4ι nihil interest utrum moderatas perturbationes approbent an
moderatam iniustrtmm, moderatam egitaniam, moderatam intemperan-
tiam.

nec potuisse...kumonitatis tuae: ‘that you could not remain un·
moved, and that to be so (id) did not accord with your cultured spirit ¹.
Humanitas almost exactly corresponds in sense with our ‘culture', ie.
education when accompanied by its best fruits, gentleness and retine·
ment.

25 valetudinem: not to be translated by ‘ill-health’ or ‘siclmess’, but
simply by· ‘health’, the English word being just as undefined as the
Latin, which receives 1ts definition from the context; cf. ro, l. 26.

26 maestitiam.- this is the right spelling, not moestitiam so maestus not
moestus, maereo not moereo.

27· recte...et mre: sc. respondeas. Cf. Academ. ι,Ι 33 nos aero volumus, .

28 officio: corresponds to maenus in l. 18 as usurpavi does to obire, l. 19.
Usnrpare is to say or do somethingflhabitually or repeatedly, here ‘to
perform regularly. Cf. 28, 1. 13‚w1th n.

29 irecommodo: note the slightness of the expression, as applied to the
death of a very dear friend, and cf. n. on 10, l 15.

constanti homini: ‘a marr of strong character’. Constans homo
(Horace’s iustus ac tmax propositi air) is opposed to mobiles in Qu.
Rosc. 493 cf. Lael. 64, l. 23 constantem et stabilem. Constantia (often
coupled with gravitas fides and the like) formed an important part οῖ’ the
character of the ideal Roman. Cic. complains (F lace. 36) nullam con·
stantiam in &aas hominibus esse.

30 contingere: here distinctly used of bad fortune, though the old
traditional distinction between contingere on the one hand and accidere,
evenire on the other required the word to be used of good fortune only. ,
Seyffert rightly compares contingere with προσήκειν and explains its
meaning to be (in the best Latin) the happening of something which is
natural or to be expected under the circumstances. Cf. N .D. 1, ry non
vidit, cum miseri animi essent, *quod plerisque contingeret (that being the
natural lot of most) tum dei partem esse rerneram3 so Eunu. ξ, sb, emb
‚Phil 14, ²43 also. below, γι, l. sapum. ιι). .
