ship, the laws were suspended in order to eleb him consul 'and
place him in command of the army before Carthage. At the
end of his year of office his command was prolonged for another
year, duu‘ngqhe course of which he took Carthage and reduced
Africa to·the condition of a Roman province. In 142 he was
censor, and in 134, though not a candidate, was elected -to the
consulship and put in command of the Roman army then
besieging the city of Numantia in Spain The war of which

’ this siege formed a part had been going on for some years most

divided as to the cause of his death. In the Laelius the death
is assumed to have been from natural'causesl. Elsewhere
however Cicero adopts the views of many of Scipio's friends
that Carbo murdered himss. Carbo afterwards lent colour to
the suspicions by putting himself to death, in order, as was
supposed, to avoid a direct prosecution. Even Gaius Gracchus
