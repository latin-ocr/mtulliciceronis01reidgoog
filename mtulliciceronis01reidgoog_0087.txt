idem semper, anirnos cta: Cic. is thinking ot' Socrates as he appears
in the dialogues of Plato, particularly in the Plraed0, Apology, Phaedrus,
and Timaeus The principal arguments in favour of the soul’s im·
mortality which are put into Socrates* mouth in the Phaedo are many
times reproduced by Cicero, and especially in Tusc. 1, Somn. Scip. and
Cato maior. In the words esse diuinos and reditum in caelum patere
Cic. recalls those arguments in favour of the soul’s pre-natal existence
which the Platonic Socrates usually joins with his arguments ior the
soul's lise aster the death of the body.

understanding corpore in the abstract sense of ‘the body’. Ch Tusc.
