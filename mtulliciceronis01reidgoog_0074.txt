6A, 1, and in one or two of Nepos, but Tacitus is the only writer who
uses the word sreely as a preposrtron. The grammars and dictionaries do
not quote Livy for the prepositional useewhich occurs in 35, 49, 1,

54.

' cnm enirn eta: the triple repetition of eune in this sentence seems
careless and inelegant, but pass es of the sort are not uncommon in
Cic.; cl. my n. on pro Balbo 1, . 3, also Fam. 9, 6, 3 curn videremus

7 feei ntprodessem: a roundabout way of saying prefici. The constr. is
a favourite one with Cic.; cf. Vat. 21 invitus faceo nt recorder ; Cat. rn.
42 invitus feci utL-Flaminiumesenatu eicerem. Cic. often gives as his
reason for writing the desire to serve his countrymen3 so Acad. 1, 113
Div. a, 53 Off. a, a. Non inuitus also iu 15, l. 4.

8 Catone maiore: see Introd. p. 10.

ro loqueretur: Cic. uses loqui (but not dicere) very frequently when the
subject is an abstract noun, as herepersona practically is. So Fin. a,
48 consuetudo loquitur ; ib. 4, 41 institutio hominis si loqueretur ; Acad.
o, ror conclusio loquuur. ·

ro floruisset: at first sight this seems a reference to the physical and
mental powers for which Cato was famous in advanced age. Cic, how·
ever, does not use florere in the sense of ve'grerq Nauck therefore is pro·
bably right in supposing the word to allude to the general worldly pros·
perity of Cato, indicated in Cat. m. 8.

maxime memorabilem: superlatives from adjectives in biles are rare.
In 51, l. 16 we have amabilissimum ; Cato has stabilissimus, Columella
mirabilissimum, and nobilissimus is comm0u; these are all the instantes
which appear until post-Augustan times. Several adjectives of this class,
as laudabiles probabilisflebtlis, have comparatives, but no superlatives. ’111
