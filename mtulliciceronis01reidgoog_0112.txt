because litterae in the sense of an epistle bas no singular) we have
only one passage like the present, viz. Off. a, 75 leges, et proximae
quaeque duriores. A glauce at that passage will shew that the reading
proximae quaeque makes poor sense; I propose to read proxima-‘lawe
and harsher, each of them, than its predecessor’. In our passage qui·
busque may be used as ἑκάστοις is often in Greek, to mean ‘each set
of people'3 or the plural may be due merely to assimilation with
pleresque. It may further be mentioned that Cicero does not use
expressions like bantus quisque, or mels'ar quisque. except when the
comparative is preceded by quo (qua quisqu meliorl·

su.

18 discidia: n. on 23, l. 16.
iusta: i. e. with good reason on one side or the other.

19g cum...pastularetur: sor this subjunctive see Roby§ 1722, Kennedy
211. ·

ao libidinis ministri: Liv. 3, 44. 6 minister decemviri libidinis.
adiutores ad: the common construction oi adiutor in Cic. is with a
genitive of the thing wherein aid is given (but dative of the person to

whom aid is given, as in 42, p. 42, l. a);> cf. however Flacc. 1 adiutor
ad rem perficiendam. Adiuuare ad, adiumentum aa' osten occur.

quad eta: ‘since those who declined, however honourabletheir
action was, were by those whom they refused to obey charged with
disregarding the claims of friendship’. Madvig, Em. Liv. p. 417
ed. a, seems to misunderstand this passage, through taking quad as the
neuter pronoun, instead of the conjunction ς so others, Halm included.

ar deserere: for the infinitivo dependent on the personal arguerentur
instead of the impersonal construction argueretur eos deserere, cf. n. on 9,
p. 29, l. 32 ut aneae also Rosc. Am. 37 Roscius arguatur uetuisse
patrem ; also quaeruntur in 16, l. cr ς constituendi runt in 56, p. 45,

26 sempiterna: in contrast to amicitiae sempiternae in 32, l. 29.

, haec eta: ‘these almost destined ends threaten friendships‚ he said,
in such numbers that etc.’. Quasi merely modities the metaphor (n. on

ytp. pb, l. a) ; satum is used very much in its poetical sense of mers or
zu ere us. ι

28 diecret sibi uideri: these words take the place οἰ esset, which would
be used it the sentence were entirely logical. Cs. De Or. a, 278 illud
Siculi cui cum stantunus quatiam quereretur quad deteret uxerem seeum
suspendisse sede ficu... similar examples are enceed'mghu commem
Cicero,· see some in Roby§ 1746.
