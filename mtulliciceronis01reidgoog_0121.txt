quesnelliana: cs. n. on οι, i. 18 doctum ‘quendam and lor auda ,
n. on 41, l. 12. Observe that Cic. writes habitas, not habeti.

18 placuisse: ‘I think that some...have held as dogmas ’ς the word
placere has osten a much stronger sense than our ‘please⁸.

· mirabilia: παράδοξα, a word which Cic. translated sometimes* by
mirabilz'a (Acad. a, 136), sometimes by admirabilia (Parad. prooem. 4 ς
Fin. 4, 74), sometimes by adneiranda.

sed: in contrast to mirabilia-⁴ paradoxes indeed, but ’.

partim: there is slight anacoluthon here; the sentence is closed
without the second partim which should correspond t'o this, and its '
place is taken by alebs at the beginning of the next sentence. Both
partim and alii refer to quibusdam. Such anacolutha, where only one
of a pair of words such as alter alter, alius alius etc. is expressed and
the other replaced (in another sentenpe) by some other expression.
are very common in Cic. ; cf. n. on 73, l. 3. Madvig has collected α large
number os exx. in the first excursus to his De Finibus.

fugiendas eta: that a man should avoid making too much os his*
friendships’ (lit. ‘that too-much friendships, excessive sriendships

are to be avoided'). Through not seeing that homini (not hamins'bus) ''. ί

is to be supplied aster fugiendas, some editors have against Latin
usage forced niaszas into meaning nimis mesltas, because of pluribus ⁴
below. In the words that follow, the emphasis lies not on unum pro
pluribus (for it is assumed that each man will have more friends then
one) but on sollicitum. Cic. is evidently here imitating a chorus of s
the l(Hippolytus of Euripides, 1. 253 sq. The nurse of Phaedra .

The sentiment is the same as that in Sophocles' Ajax 680 ἔς τε ’
