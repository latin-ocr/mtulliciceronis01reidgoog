7 praeripr’endumfiaeit: sc. ei nauiumque ert hupraaepram.
ut eam diligentiam ut: for the very inelegant, but common subor-
. dination of one utalause to another see my n. on pro Balbo 6ο.

13 his igitur eta: ‘1 think then we must adopt such limits as that... ’.
15 siueulla exceptum communitas: n. ou ao, p. 34, 1. 6.

17 aut caput agatur aut firma: for the arrangement of the words cf.
n. on 8, l. ar. Caput is rtatus,· the cases alluded to are those which
might lead to deminutio capitis. In sama the reference is to trials in-
volving infirmia as part of the punishment which may result from
them.

18 declinandum da via sit: on the nice question of casuistry‚ how far
one is to condone the wrong doings of a friend, Laelius is conveniently
vague, as Gellius in his criticism of this passage (Noct. Att. 1, 3. 14)
complains. The passage becomes the more unsatisfactory when we
go back to Laelius’ first principle iu 5 18- urii in baur's amicitiam esse
nan passe. Aristotle's discussion of the matter is more careful though
still vagus: Eth. Nic. 9, 4, 3 ἄρ’ οὖν εὐθὺς διαλυτέον, ἢ οὐ raro, ἄλλο’.
τοῖς ἀνιάτοις διά τὴν μοχθηρίανς ἐπανόρθωσιν δ’ ἔχουσι, μᾶλλον βοηθητέον
εἱς τό ἦθος, ἢ τήν οὐσίαν...6ο’ξειε δ’ ἂν ὀ διαλυόμενος οὐδὲν ἄτοπον ποιεῖν.
Roman popular morality required a man to go much greater lengthi
in assisting a friend than would be allowed even by the popular morality
of our time; this is expressed in the words modo na summa turpitudo

sequatur.

19 estquatcnus: cf. est ubi, est arni and the lilre; also n. on 69, 1. 68.

66 nummata: it is not at first sight easy to see the connexion of the
whole of this sentence with what goes before. ‘Nor, however, must
we be careless of our reputation [ie. in our anxiety to serve a friend],
nor yet must we suppose that the goodwill of our felloweountryrnen is
an unimportant weapon in the conduct of public affairs [ic. we must
not by going too great le hs in compliance with a friend run the
risk of losing the goodwill o our fellow·countrymen and of so becoming
useless as public servants, though tt is disgraoeful to earn that good·
