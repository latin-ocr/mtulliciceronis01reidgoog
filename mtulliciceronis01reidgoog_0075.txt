⁶6 DE AMICITIA. [ᾖ 4-·

13 clionee: ‘I thought Laelius a suitable character to expound the very
views which had been maintained by him and recalled to mind by
Scaevola'. Literally‘which, maintained byhim, Sc. had recalled '. It
is not necessary to supply esse so as to make this a case of the perfect in-
finitive after numinisset. Disputare aliquid (cf. n on 1, 1. 6) often means
not to discuss an opinion, but to put an opinion sor-araret in, discussion,
and so to defendor maintain it; cf. 11. on 8, l. ar respondere. ’

15 genus autem eta: ‘discourses of this kind seem, somehow or other,
to acquire eater dignity when they rely on (lit. are founded on) the
influente oihncient characters, particularly such as are renowned’.
Observe genus hoc sermonum=sermones leuius generis; cl. ra, p. 31, l. a

more sormally correct3 so below, ll. ao, ar tum...nunc.

ar scripsi de amicitia ,· it is not often that Cic. leaves out the object aster
seribere; above in 4, l. 5 aliquid is added. Sometimes a qualifying adverb
takes the place of the object, as Att. 9, 15, 5 quod scribis measperius
quam mei patiantur mores ele Dionysio scripsisse. Here the phrase ad
antaeum amice'ssimus sosteus the construction. cf. however Fam. 9, 16,

possent ,· also 51, l. 23 scalam ,⁰ 47. 1. 10 vetitas. When Cic. uses the sub· ’
unctive construction after volo he nearly always leaves out ut, as here.
ilemark also that the subject of the dependentverb, if expressed, always
precedes the words velim, vellem, malim and the like, as in the present
passage3 cf. also Tusc. 5, ao nos vellem proemio elicere possemus, and
am. 15, 3,a.

15 Laeliumputes: the omission of a conjunction to connect two clauses
together is particularly common iu Cic. when two clauses are contrusae,
as here and below, ab leis sermo ore'tur, respondet Laelius ,· ct 49, l. 3²3

however (below), the clauses are not contrasted, but parallel.
