important influence was added, that of the Greek philosophy.
Although the wisdom of the Greeks was known in part to the
Romans at a much earlier time its practical power over them
dates from the famous Athenian embassy of 153 Re. composed
of the three great philosophers Carneades the Academic,
Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic. After this
time all the Greek systems struck root at Rome, but by far the
greatest influence was exerted by Stoicism, of which nearly all
the members of Scipio's society had a more or less strong
tincture. Thus Scipio himself was devoted to the society of the
Stoic philosopher Panaetius; Laelius had learned Stoicism

both from Panaetius and Diogenes. There are many tinges of ,

Stoicism traceable in our dialogue. These noble Romans, how-
ever, adopted the Stoic philosophy more on account of its utility
in supplying a foundation for theories of law and government
than as aform of saith. The Stoicism they professed was also
a Stoicism deprived of its paradoxes and specially adapted to
Roman tastes In this form it ultimately exercised a profound
influence on thenational life of Rome.

Though the prevalent bent of the Scipionic circle was towards
Stoicism, it was sar from rejecting the society of those who
adhered to other systems. Thus Clitomachus, the New
Academic, was the ¹⁴friend of many Romans of high station in
his time.

On the literary side the circle of Scipio and Laelius was
strong. To it belonged Polybius, the great historian, Lucilius
the satirist, and the dramatists Terenceand Pacuvius, with
many others scarcely less distinguished.

We cannot here give any detailed account of the persons
who formed this brilliant society, but must confine ourselves to
such information as is necessary to illustrate the Laelius. ln
ξ 11 of the dialogue we have some of the chief events of SCIPlo's
life indicated. Born in 185 B.c., the son of L. Aemilius Paullus
the conqueror of Macedonia, he became the adopted son of the
son of the elder Africanus, just before the outbreak of the Third
¹ Punic War. , His services in a subordinate position in that war,
