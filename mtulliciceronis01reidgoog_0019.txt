ro INTRODUCTIOM

must be clearly understood, however, that the New Academy
taught no complete philosophical system It simply pro-
claimed the view that in the field os knowledge certainty is
nnattainable, and that all the inquiret has to do is to balance
probabilities against each other. The New Academic therefore>
was free to accept any opinions which seemed to him to have·
probabilities on their side, but he was bound to be ready to
abandon them when anything came before him which would
alter his view of the probabilities. The New Academic, then,
not only might be, but could not help-being eclectic, that is·
he chose such views propounded by other schools as seemed to·
him to be most reasonable or probable at the moment The
three principal systems in· Cicero's time were the Stoic, the
Peripatetic and the Epicurean With the last of these, whose
supporters advocated in ethics the pursuit of pleasure, in science
the doctrine ol the atoms, in religion the complete inactivity of
the gods, Cleero had absolutely no sympathy. ln his time the
other two schools, the Stoic and Peripatetic‚ were divided by
. comparatively unimportant differences. As regards ethics (in
the eye of the ancients almost the whole of philosophy, which
itself was defined as ‘the art os living') the main question
between the two schools was the amount of importance to be
attributed to'Virtue, the Stoics declaring that in comparison
with Virtue‚ all other things sank into absolute insignificance,
while the Peripatetics declared that they had a certain though
infinitesimally small significance. Cicero generally takes the
Peripatetic view, though with many leanings towards some of
the details of the Stoic ethical system. The Stoic opinion that it
was the duty of the wise man to abstain from public lile, which
, the Peripatetics contested, Cicero decisively rejected.

applications of those principles. The consideration of Friend-
