134 DE AMICITIA. [ᾗ 73...
ἓ 73.

3 ’ sustinere: Seyffert rightly explains sustinere here to mean alicui oneri
parem csse, quoting Verr. 3, 189 nom eum oratori orcus aliquod imponi·
tar, orationis ipsius uis ac ratio consideranda cst, quid ca sustinere, quid
poli, quid cfficm possit ae debeat. Trans. ‘you‘must confer on each
person just so much as you in the first place can secure to him, next as
he whom you love and aid is able to bear’. For the omission of possit
to be supplied from possis ci. n. on 30, p· 38, l. 5.

non...ncquc: cf. n. on 10, l. 4. Notice that there is a slight ana·
coluthon‚ the form ol the sentence being changed, and lor the proper
clause introduced by a second neque the clauses introduced by utare
substituted. Cs.n.on45,l.19portim. The unemphatic tu should be
¹ noticed ; it is our English ‘you' sor ‘one'.
4 excellas: cf. excellentiae iu 69, p. 50, l. 1.

5 perducere: lit. ‘to bring through’, ie. as Seyffert explains, through
all the various grades. Produccrc (which some editions have) is simply
‘to advance’ without the notion of gradation.

potuit...norc potuit: cf. n. on 19, l. 28. In Tusc- 4, 40 Rupilius is
said to have taken his brother’s defeat greatly to heart ; and Pliny, Nat.
Hist. 7, ἕ 122 (where some recent edd. have Rutilium wrongly) enlarges
the story by malring him die immediately on hearing the result of the
election. ’

6 efficere: facere would not have done here, since fieccre aliquem con-
sulem means ‘to vote sor some one's election as consul ’.

8 amicitiae iudicandae sunt: :iudicandum cst dc amicitiis ‘a decision

must be come to about friendships’, though Cicero would not say eudi-
corc amicitias for dc amicitiis.

corroboratis...oetatibus: ‘when strength and steadiness have come
over the mind and life’. Seyffert wrongly insists on taking these abla-
tives (which are ablatives absolute) as ablatives of measure after cudi·
candoe sunt ‘by the strengthening and steadying of the mind and life'.
Had Cic. meant this he would have written corroborandis. But how can
it be said that advancing years supply a measure or standard sor judging
about friendships? The confirmato or corroborata actos is the time of
life immediately succeeding youth, the καθεστηκυῖα ἡλικία of Thucydides ;
ci. pro Caelio 41 qua varietate non modo leacc actos sed aare corroborato
caperetur. The opposite expression is infirmissimum tempus aetates in
Acad. a, 93 Flacc. 5.

11 habuc: the constructiori is carried on as though oportet iudicare de
amudiis or something similar had preceded3 old edd. indeed insert
oportet, which is unnecessary. In F in. a, 103 quod si dics notandus fuit,
cumae potius quo notus on cum quo sopiens factus est the words oportet
rectore have to be supplied from notandus. In his n. there Madvig ex·

cellently illustrares the usage both from Latin audirem Greek.
