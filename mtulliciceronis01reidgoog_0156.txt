lex...Crassi: C. Licinius Crassus, tribune in 145, proposed to make
election to all priesthoods go by popular vote. When a vacancy occurred
in a priestly college the remaining members filled up the vacancy as
they pleased. A measure like that of Crassus was carried in 104by
Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, a tribune. In opposing the law of Crassus, ,
Laelius (whose oration is mentioned in Brut. 83 ; N. D. 3, 5 and 43, in
which last passage it is called aureola) maintained that the state had no
right to control the order of religious observance. A curious method
was adopted to get over this objection. The electiori to priesthoods
was at an assembly of a minority (17) of the 35 tribes, the particular
tribes which took part in it being determined by lot. While, theo·
retically, a resolution of the minority of the nation had no binding effect,
and therefore could not be offensive to the gods, still in practice the
collegas were bound to appoint the persons so nominated, though the
form of cooptatio was gone through. The colleges of priests had great

26 primus instituit eta: the interpretation of this passage is difficull.
Plutarch, lise of C. Gracchus c. 5, tells the tale of C. Gracchus, and as·
signs to the act a democratic purpose. Our passage certainly seems to
countenance Plutarch in this, but Lange, Ro'mische Alterthiimer 11¹ 443,
denies that the act had any political aim. He connects it with a change
in the voting at public assemblies. This originally took place in the
comitium, which formed a small part of what was ordinarily called the
foruna. Lange thinks that when the voting was transferred from the
comitium to the saepta (enclosures) the speakers naturally turned their
backs on the comitium and faced the saepta, the rostra being placed be-
tween them. The matter is far from clear, and Lauge’s explanation
seems scarcely to fit in with our passage.
